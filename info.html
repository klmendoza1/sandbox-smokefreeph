            <h2>Weakened Immune System</h2>
            <p>Cigarette smoke contains high levels of tar and other chemicals, which can make your immune
              system less effective at fighting off infections. This means you're more likely to get sick, and are
              vulnerable to even the common cold and the flu.</p>

            <h2>A Chance for Cancer</h2>
            <p>A single cigarette contains over 4,800 chemicals, 69 of which are known to cause cancer.
              Smoking gives cancer a chance to take over your body and increases the risks of getting more smoking-
              related diseases. Over 30% of cancer could be prevented by avoiding tobacco and alcohol, having a
              healthy diet and physical activity. Don’t give cancer a chance.</p>

            <h2>Issue of the Heart</h2>
            <p>The chemicals in tobacco smoke harm your blood cells. Smoking raises blood pressure,
              which increases the risk of stroke. It can also can damage the function of your heart and the
              structure and function of your blood vessels.  Although nicotine is the main active agent in
              cigarette smoke, other chemicals and compounds such as tar and carbon monoxide are also
              harmful to your heart in many ways.</p>

            <h2>Less Life to Live</h2>
            <p>Every cigarette you smoke reduces your expected lifespan by 11 minutes. On average, smokers
              die 10 years earlier than non­smokers. For every person who dies because of smoking, at least 30 people
              live with a serious smoking­related illness. There’s more to life than the stick you light.</p>
